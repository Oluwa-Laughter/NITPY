This is my first repository on Github

I learnt my first programming language (python) at NITDA UNILAG

It a tech HUB and a workspace for all TECHIES we call the Organization NITHUB,

This repository is for all what we learnt during the course of the NITHUB python programming cohort(NITPY)

The program went for 12 weeks and to us who learnt and made it to the Final class,

We were all given a project(TEXT-BASED-ADVENTURE-GAME) to work on.

Yes,I did mine and It's also attached to this repo (final_class_and_project.py) file.
